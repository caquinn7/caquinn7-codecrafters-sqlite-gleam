### Question
Do interior table b-tree pages ever have more than two children?

Yes, interior table B-tree pages in SQLite can and usually do have more than two children. The number of children is determined by the number of keys (cells) on the page. An interior B-tree page with \( K \) keys will have \( K+1 \) children. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Keys on Interior Pages**: Each interior B-tree page stores keys that divide the space into subspaces. Each key is associated with a child page.
2. **Children Pointers**: In addition to the keys, there are pointers to child pages. These pointers are:
   - A pointer to the left child of the first key.
   - Pointers to the right child of each key.

Thus, for an interior page with \( K \) keys, there are \( K+1 \) children (one extra pointer to the right-most child).

### Example

If an interior page has 3 keys, it will have 4 children:

```
| key1 | key2 | key3 |
| ptr1 | ptr2 | ptr3 | ptr4 |
```

- `ptr1` points to the child page where all keys are less than `key1`.
- `ptr2` points to the child page where keys are between `key1` and `key2`.
- `ptr3` points to the child page where keys are between `key2` and `key3`.
- `ptr4` points to the child page where all keys are greater than `key3`.

### Number of Keys and Children

For a given page:
- **Number of keys**: \( K \)
- **Number of children**: \( K + 1 \)

### Question
Which pointer points to the page on which I would find the key that is equal to key1?

In an interior B-tree page, the pointers (`ptr1`, `ptr2`, etc.) direct you to child pages where the actual keys are stored. The key itself (`key1` in this case) is used to determine the range of keys in the child pages.

Here's the detailed logic for an interior B-tree page:

- **`ptr1`**: Points to the child page where all keys are less than `key1`.
- **`ptr2`**: Points to the child page where all keys are greater than or equal to `key1`.

If you're searching for a key that is exactly equal to `key1`, you will follow `ptr2`. This is because, in an interior B-tree page, `ptr2` leads to the child page that contains the key equal to `key1` or any keys greater than `key1`.

In summary, to find the key equal to `key1`, you would use the pointer (`ptr2`) that points to the right-most child in the interior B-tree page that has `key1`.
